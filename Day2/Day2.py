#Data Types
#For int we can't do print(len(2345)) #give out an error message
#Strings
#this extraction of char by char is called subscripting
# print("Hello"[4])


#Fact in python we could write 123456987 if we write it as 
# 123,456,789 its interpreted by python as 123456789 instead


#Float - nums that have decimal points 
#Eg 3.146789 is

#Boolean- True or False 

#Type conversion 
#we use type( ) function to get the type of data type 
#class<int> also with type checking we can change data types 
#called type casting

# new_num_char= str(number_it_is)

print(70+int("30"))

print("70"+"100")


print(70+float("10.2"))
